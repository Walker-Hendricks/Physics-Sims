    "## Introduction\n",
    "The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) is a complicated experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. It is one of the two major experiments along the LHC, being diametrically opposite to the other, ATLAS. The goal of this experiment is to measure the energy-momentum four-vectors of particles emerging from $pp$ collisions, which requires very technical equipment. One component of the CMS is the **electromagnetic calorimeter**, or **ECAL**. This component attempts to measure the four-vectors of the smaller QED particles: the electron, the positron, and the photon. "

    "## Our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the crystals is outlined in the [CMS TDR (technical design report)](https://jinst.sissa.it/LHC/CMS/ch04.pdf). They are square pyramidal frusta with a front face of 22x22mm$^2$ and a back face of 26x26mm$^2$, made of the heavy metal oxide lead tungstate ($\\textrm{PbWO}_4$). Based on the TDR, they appear to be bounded by a thin layer of air. In the TDR, it describes the surroundings of the crystal as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The centres of the front faces of the crystals are at a radius 1.29 m. The crystals are contained\n",
    "in a thin-walled alveolar structure (submodule). The alveolar wall is 0.1 mm thick and is made of an\n",
    "aluminium layer, facing the crystal, and two layers of glass fibre-epoxy resin. To avoid oxidation,\n",
    "a special coating is applied to the aluminium surface. The nominal crystal to crystal distance is\n",
    "0.35 mm inside a submodule, and 0.5 mm between submodules\n",
    "\n",
    "From my understanding, this appears to be a 0.35mm crystal-to-crystal separation with two 0.1mm alveolar walls in between. This then leaves a gap of (0.35/2) - 0.1 mm = 75$\\mu$m around each crystal, presumably of air. Given that the index of refraction of the crystals is $n_{\\textrm{PbWO}_4} \\sim 2.29$ and the index of refraction for air is $n_{air} \\sim 1$, we will have total internal reflection here. Thus, the CMS ECAL crystals act as optical fibers, funneling the light down the crystal to the detector at the end (a SiPM).\n",
    "\n",
    "While for the purposes of the CMS a fiber-like description of the material is suitable, a geometric ray optics approach breaks down for a fiber when the wavelength of the incident light is comparable to the transverse size of the fiber itself. This of course is not a problem for the CMS ECAL, but it *does* pose an interesting area of examination for the purposes of me getting a good grade on this E&M assignment! ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this notebook is broken into two parts: the first part will deal with the ECAL crystal from a geometric/ray optics approach, looking at things like ray tracing and total internal reflection, while the second part will deal with finding the normal modes of the dielectric crystal. Let's get started!"
